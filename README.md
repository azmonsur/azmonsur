I'm a data professional with experience in SQL Server, SSIS, Excel, and Power BI - and I help small businesses and agencies save hours weekly by automating their reports and data workflows.

I can help you:
- Convert spreadsheets into interactive dashboards
- Automate your monthly reporting using SSIS/SSRS
- Clean, structure, and visualize your data using Python or SQL

If this sounds like something that could ease your work, I’d love to send you a demo or build a simple sample for free.

Thanks.
